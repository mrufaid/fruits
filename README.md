# Fruits and Vegetables Image Classification

This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of fruits an vegetables into different categories. The dataset used in this project contains images of fruits an vegetables from various categories, and the goal is to train a model to classify them accurately.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/mrufaid/fruits
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Python file:
   ```bash
   python my_project.py
   ```

### Usage

1. Download the dataset and organize it as described in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the CNN model and make predictions.

3. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

4. The trained model can classify images of houses into different categories.

## Dataset
